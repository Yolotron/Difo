DIFO - Derivated Income Funding Operations.
A non-zero-sum platform to redirect any passive income stream to replace funding, sponsoring, donations, and subscription models.
For everyone to redirect passive income streams. For everyone to get an option for resources. 

(The DEMO video does not work at the dashboard; see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw4vgzHtpe8 )

   What is "NON-ZERO-SUM"?
  "Non-zero-sum describes a situation in which the interacting parties' aggregate gains and losses can be less than or more than zero. No loser / Win-Win."

THE PROBLEM: 
-The total TVL and the volume of passive income streams (PIS) generated with DEFI keeps growing, also the utility of tokens, but not additional utilities to those income streams are been develop.

-Bad actors and Scammers have access to get big amounts of funds in very short and hyped token sales. 
As we know, they just need to clon a Telegram group and make a fake web, someone falls always, the FOMO and the hype makes us blind...

-Lack of non-zero-sun structures. 

THE SOLUTION:

Redirect Passive Income Streams, (PIS); 
A non-zero-sum / Risk free funding platform.
A non-zero-sum subscription platform. 
A non-zero-sum donations platform.
A non-zero-sum minting platform.

Also ScammBusters. 

With the option to open stream channels from SuperFlud, anyone will be able to take stake any coin (STAKEDAO), o provide liquidity to the top protocols (Aave, Compound, Uniswap, Pods,...), and redirect every desired passive income stream (PIS) via DIFO to a selected Ethereum wallet address. 

Naturally, these contracts can be covered with NEXUSMUTUAL services. 

In exchange for redirecting passive income streams (PIS), supporters will receive rewards in form of SuperToken or SOTEN created with SuperFluid, representing the project, or other benefits like subscription pass and benefits, similar to how Patreon works. 

The projects or entities listed to get PIS will be passing a list of needs and get hardly stressed with UPSHOT*, and a ScammBusters team, and so, get a decentralized trust score for the projects.

Making use of the Uma KPI (Key performance indicator), projects that reached predetermined targets in time before given time, will receive additional PIS APY. 
At the same time gaining trust for further PIS supporters.

This solves already known problems, for example, a bad actor had to keep the reputation up for a long period of time, because PIS can be canceled, which makes it more difficult for scammers to run with huge amounts of funds, due to the nature of the PIS drops. 

All this variety of possible coins generating PIS can be a mesh for projects to handle, for which we will integrate CIRCLE USD, all rewards will be Swapped via PARASWAP / INSTADAPP  to USDC (SuperToken) in the POLYGON layer* and finally, send to projects. 

The TVL represented by Sotens (DifoV1) can be used as collateral to boost the project, via AAVE borrow USDC which will be sent to the project in exchange for Sotens, giving both sides a boost. 
A % of the PIS will be used to pay back this loan. 
(EVTL these borrowed funds will be used to initiate a pool in Uniswap, generating the initial matching amount of the project token, fees earned will be used to pay back the loan first.) 

We will integrate the option to initiate this process in a self-paid way (token creation and other initial costs)
Making use of the LAZY MINT option of RARIBLE - Where the token gets created once the PIS starts.
For people without the resources. 

On top of it, we will create an optional Quadratic Funding matching DIFO pool(QFDP)  for non-zero-sum social goods fundings. 

Also, a victims DIFO will be created, imagine a reversed QFDPl,  for victims of natural disasters or other disgraces to have a place to share their story and ask for PIS or other types of support. P2P non-zero-sum donations.


DIFO could be integrated synergetically with the StakeDao services and Pillar Wallet because of the nature of their services. 

The use cases are endless.
