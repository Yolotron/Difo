NiftyTac Is the platform to trade what money can not buy. The ownership is key. One holds it, another one desires it. But it is not for sale, at least not for money.

NiftyTac is the first platform of its type, allowing exchange of values in streamed fractionized NFTs, which could be Real Estate, Art or even Inheritances. 

The unsolved problems Niftytac overcomes are that:
- Until now trading has been impossible without actual money. Niftytac solves this.
- And, once a deal has been done, it has always been impossible to participate in its eventual future value. 
Niftyyac solves this.
Now we appreciate the Why let's see the How.

Niftytac opens the mind to a new architecture of commerce, in which the parties can participate in long term contractual conditions based on the volatility of the medium or other stipulated conditions. 

- Payments without money, but of Value.
By fractionalizing an NFT and opening a stream channel of its parts, or ownership, it allows for its use as a Value of Exchange, which is a novel way of dealing with settlements. 

There are two case examples, one where the medium of payment is growing over time, but not the asset. Or where the asset is growing over time but not necessarily the medium, for example performing arts and future professionals.

Compensating the counterparty with % over time, with variables which will change the amount and/or time. 

For example;
Maria wants to buy an NFT of her preferred artist, but the price is to high, so she offers a deal based on time, she disposes of a 1000 $ monthly from which she offers to stream 25% to buy the NFT based on micro payments, receiving in exchange equivalent fractions of the NFT. 

So, both sides are guaranteed the legitimacy of the deal, and the second the money is sent, the NFT is under new ownership.

Making the volatility affect both parties, for good or for bad, but based on real time ownership. 

Another of the use cases could be to pay a salary in fractions of an NFT, a BEEPLE maybe, or for 'pro rata' participation in future profits.

How it's made
By fractionizing Zora NFTs, Audius NFTs, Unlock NFts, or other IPFS based NFTs, and opening stream channels of those fractions via Superfluid under conditions.
